IABC Regina chapter will benefit from an updated website in a few impactful ways. First they will potentially attract more new members, they are communication professionals and their current site makes for poor communication. It is difficult to take communicators who canâ€™t communicate effectively seriously.  Second, by having a more professional appearance and larger audience, they could attract more job posters and increase that stream of revenue.
